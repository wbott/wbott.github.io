                            I was fortunate enough to work with William at SSP for several years. I am more on the implementation side and William was in product. We had many conversations about the direction of the products, and challenges during implementation. <strong>William was always proactive and took a genuine leadership role in ensuring that we were delivering quality products to our customers.</strong> William is just very insightful, intelligent, and effective in driving business requirements and concepts to a delivered solution. Thank you William for teaching me new things and allowing me to expand my knowledge of product management.

                            I had the pleasure of working with William on a variety of projects, most recently in collaboration on Schneider Electric's strategic initiative to enter the Industrial Internet of Things market segment. <strong>William's role as the Project Owner during the development of the "big data" platform and accompanying analytics engine was crucial to the success of not only the project, but also Schneider's entry into this emerging space.</strong> He did an excellent job bridging the gap between business owners and the product development team. His collaborative approach and rigorous attention to the Agile NPD process drove this project to a winning completion.
